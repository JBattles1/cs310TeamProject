# Project Details
This project was assigned in my CS 310 Software Engineering class. In this project, we collaborated as a four person team to work as a software engirneering unit. The project spanned four months and we were given projects that could be seen as real world experience. As a team, we followed the SCRUM workflow to complete the project that our project owner had given us. We had weekly SCRUM meetings to discuss our progress, as well as discuss how we could improve our work and the entire process. The project called for a time-punch system that would be able to work under various conditions. Our team collaborated to finish much of the project. We used MySQL to keep track of data in our database, and wrote all of our code in java to acheive our goal. With each feature that we would complete, we ran unit test and would upload to our github repository. It was a very difficult project that we saw setbacks on, but as a whole our team pulled through and completed great work together. The code, as is, works fine as intended, but lacks completetion of two features. We received full credit for the assignment. 

This project invloved many difficult tasks. A great amount of problem solving and logical thinking went into it. We are proud of ourselves as a team for what we accomplished and are confident that we made ourselves better programmers after completetion. This is the most difficult project I have worked on to date.
