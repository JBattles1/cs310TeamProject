# Project Details
This project was assigned in my CS 310 Software Engineering class. In this project, we collaborated as a four person team to work as a software engirneering unit. We used the agile project management process. The project spanned four months and we were given projects that could be seen as real world experience. As a team, we followed the SCRUM workflow to complete the project that our project owner had given us. We had weekly SCRUM meetings with our SCRUM Mster to discuss our progress, as well as discuss how we could improve our work and the entire process. Communication was a very important factor for our team. We completed our tasks in short one week sprints. During the entire process we followed the SCRUM workflow very closey and learned how to follow the process professionally. There are benefits to the SCRUM workflow over those such as WATERFALL, and we got to experience them hands on. The project called for a time-punch system that would be able to work under various conditions. It involved accessing the database through java and getting data that involved a list of workers for a hypothethical company. We programmed a system that would treat each punch in and punch out as an object in java. Query searches were some of the most diffcult problems we had to solve having had no exposure to any databases prior. Each worker had a badge id, which was received from the database to keep track of each punch per worker. Each shift had parameters of 15 minutes before and after the employees designated work time, as well as a 30 minute lunch break, and our program calculated it all in real-time. We were able to test our results using the JaCoCo Robotframework which proved to be very useful. Our team collaborated to finish much of the project. We used MySQL to keep track of data in our database, and wrote all of our code in java to acheive our goal. With each feature that we would complete, we ran unit tests until they were positive and then would upload to our github repository. It was a very difficult project that we saw setbacks on, but as a whole our team pulled through and completed quality work together. The code, as is, works fine as intended, but could still be built further to create an entire working system. 

This project invloved many difficult tasks. Our entire team were amatuers when we began facing these tasks. We overcame many obstacles and saw a few issues that we had to rely on each other to fix. A great amount of problem solving and logical thinking, as well as teamwork went into this project. We are proud of ourselves as a team for what we accomplished and are confident that we made ourselves better programmers after completetion. This is the most difficult project I have worked on to date.
